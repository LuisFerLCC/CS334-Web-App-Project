o	Shop
-Created a dynamic display of available items using javascript to create addition product cards.
-Javascript is using JSON in order to fill in the product details, adding in manually is the current functionality.
-Created basic styling and updated it to look like the other sites.
-Created ability to modify the quantity of items and add to a localstorage cart.
o	Cart
-Cart was created using localstorage and an iterator to dynamically calculate total cost and tax.
-Requires input at this time but does not do input validation.
-If submitted with items for card data, will prompt a hidden message on the page, wait 3 seconds, and then clear the cart and move you back to the shop.
-Ensured styling was consistent with other pages.
